Mapping an OCR output of a scanned document into a grid layout, in order to capture the layout information for better document understanding.
A grid layout (numpy array of predefined shape in taken)
rows and columns of each text is calculated using:
 r_i = r_g * (x_left_i + w_i/2)/W
 c_i = c_g * (y_top_i + h_i/2)/H
 
 r_i --> row of ith word
 c_i --> col of ith word
 r_g --> predefined max rows
 c_g --> predefined max cols
 x_left_i --> top left x coordinate of ith word
 w_i --> width of ith word
 y_top_i --> top left y coordinate of ith word
 h_i --> height of ith word
 W --> image width
 H --> image height
 
 This grid layout preserves the relative position of the words which otherwise gets discarded and helps in document layout understanding.
